    <p>My name is Thai Cornelius and this is my first website. I live in the Bay Area. I have attended Oakland Military Institute since the 6th grade (2014-2015) and next year I will be moving on to the 11th grade. When I found out about the Hidden Genius Project, I thought that it would be a good oppourtiunity for me. I hope to learn many skills in the Hidden Genius Project so that I can be successful in the future</p>

    <h3>About The Hidden Genius Project</h3>
    <p>The Hidden Genius Projects mission statement is "The Hidden Genius Project trains and mentors black male youth in technology creation, Entrepreneurship, and Leadership skills to transform their lives and communities" They take young black boys in so that they can be taught more skills and be given more oppourtunities that they would usually have. They exspose the Geniuses to multiple buisness which gives them the oppourtunity to both see the buinsess life/setting and meet the workers which can possibly give them the chance for internships.</p>
